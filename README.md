# Disapproved Ad Checker

## Overview

This Ads Script helps owners of a Google Ads manager account review disapproved
ads in its sub accounts. The script will scan up to 1,000 sub accounts each day
and write information about found disapproved ads to account-specific
spreadsheets inside a dated Drive folder. A central spreadsheet is updated each
day with links to the latest account spreadsheets so that the latest data is
quickly accessible.

# Account Anomaly Detector - Manager Account

## Overview

This Ads Script alerts owners of a Google Ads manager account whenever the
behavior of a linked Google Ads account differs significantly from how it
performed in the past. When an issue is encountered, the script will send the
user an alerting email. Only one alert is sent per day.

The script compares todayâ€™s stats to historical averages for the same day of
week. For instance, stats for 1pm on a Tuesday are compared with stats for the
previous 26 Tuesdays. You can adjust the number of weeks to look back depending
on the age and stability of your account.

The view provided by the MCC Account Anomaly Detector shows a summary of all
accounts under a managing account. This allows for an easy, at-a-glance view of
the performance of the accounts.
